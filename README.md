# PythonAPIChallenge

Fan fucking tastic to get sick after the last class of the week. Have had stuffy sinuses and a head cold but that won't stop me. Will slow me down though.
Thank you Asiha Braxton-Garvin as you were a stellar help as a tutor and I would definitely choose you again.
My classmate Amanda shared her code with me so it helped confirm some ideas I had and an error I had with northern and southern hemispheres.
askBCS worked pretty well this time and I got some solid help.
