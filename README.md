Fan freaking tastic to get sick after the last class of the week. Have had stuffy sinuses and a head cold but that won't stop me. Will slow me down though.
Thank you Asiha Braxton-Garvin as you were a stellar help as a tutor and I would definitely choose you again.
My classmate Amanda shared her code with me so it helped confirm some ideas I had and an error I had with northern and southern hemispheres.
askBCS worked pretty well this time and I got some solid help.

It's about 6 hours later from my last upload. I got stuck on step 1 having errors of part 2 and I went on askBCS and was on call for over 90 minutes while the guy I was talking to had to talk to his guy cause he couldn't figure the issue. Ian and Brandon thank you two for your time. We are now done I hope so lets rock n stone
